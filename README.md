# Practicing TDD with Java

TDD makes you make:

1. Write classes/methods/getters/setters in the test, but obviously fails becuase no code is written yet. So to make the test pass it forces you to go and write the code for these elements. So it forces you to write minimul code.
2. Make design decisions as you make your test pass
3. Write asserstions that will fail and error message explains why it failed. This provides the hint for you what code is needed to make the test pass

TDD golden rule

"We do not write a code unless the test requires it"

Writing a test and it fails !

Start adding methods and other classes as we attempt to make the tests pass
